## 2. Why we created leanote
To be honest, our inspiration comes from Evernote. We use Evernote to manage our knowledge everyday. But we find that:
* Evernote's editor can't meet our needs, it does not have document navigation, it does not render code properly (as a programmer, syntax highlighted code rendering is a basic need), it cannot resize images and so forth
* We like markdown, but Evernote does not support it.
* We want to share our knowledge, so all of us have our blogs (e.g. on Wordpress) and our Evernote accounts, but why can not those two be one!

### 3.2. Install MongoDB

Leanote is written in go using [revel](https://revel.github.io/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org). Thus, you need to first install MongoDB.

For more tips please have a look at [our wiki](https://github.com/leanote/leanote/wiki/Install-Mongodb)

### 3.3. Import initial MongoDB data

The mongodb data is in `[PATH_TO_LEANOTE]/mongodb_backup/leanote_install_data`

```
$> mongorestore -h localhost -d leanote --directoryperdb PATH_TO_LEANOTE/mongodb_backup/leanote_install_data
```

The initial database contains two users:

```
user2 username: admin, password: abc123 (administrator)
user3 username: demo, password: demo@leanote.com (this user is for demo)
```

### 3.4. Configuration

Modify `[PATH_TO_LEANOTE]/conf/app.conf`. Available configuration options are:

``mongodb``  **required**

```Shell
db.host=localhost
db.port=27017
db.dbname=leanote
db.username=
db.password=
```

``app.secret`` **required** **important**
The secret key used for cryptographic operations (revel.Sign).
